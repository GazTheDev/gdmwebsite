            Hello, as I'm sure your aware my name is Gareth, I'm 22 and from the United Kingdom. I mainly build websites for businesses in and around my local area but recently I decided to start 
            freelancing properly and attracting clients throughout the United Kingdom. I like to keep things simple for my clients websites. I always find minimalistic websites best and return better results for the clients. 
            You may have noticed a few things about this website, It's blazing fast, it has unique animations and is simple to use. 
            <br/>
          
Recently, I've started using and prototyping some new tech stacks. I used to build my websites from WordPress but recently I found that GatsbyJS and React are the way forward for me. I want to create cutting edge websites with as little loading time as possible for my clients. 
That isn't to say I won't be using WordPress from time to time but I'm now focussing my time and reccomending GatsbyJS to my clients. 

<br /> 

Anyway, enough of me geeking out. If you want to hire me then please get in contact using the contact from on the contact page.
